# 🎓 Student Performance Power BI Project

Welcome to the Student Performance Dashboard – a Power BI-driven analysis of student data designed to uncover trends in academic outcomes, payment behaviour, subject demand, and enrolment across time and geography.

This project dives deep into how students perform, how they engage with institutions, and how patterns emerge in the data when seen from the right angles. Built in both basic and intermediate levels, the dashboards offer flexible tools for educators, administrators, and analysts to make informed decisions.

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project started with a core question: *What can student performance data tell us beyond grades?*

By combining enrolment records, payment methods, grades, and academic outcomes, this dashboard delivers visual insights into academic distribution, subject trends, payment patterns, and more. The project is divided into two levels to showcase both foundational and advanced Power BI skills.

## 🎯 Project Goals  
This analysis focuses on:  
- Tracking student enrolment and academic trends across time and regions  
- Visualising subject popularity by country  
- Highlighting grade distributions and pass/fail outcomes  
- Analysing payment method preferences and patterns  
- Comparing basic and intermediate dashboarding techniques in Power BI  

---

## 🌐 Data Overview  
The dataset includes anonymised student-level data such as:  
- Enrolment Date  
- Country  
- Subject Stream (Arts, Commerce, Engineering, Science)  
- Grade Category (A, B, C, D)  
- Pass/Fail Status  
- Payment Method (Credit Card, Cash, Bank Transfer, Online)  
- Book Return Month

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation  
All data was prepared using Power BI’s built-in tools:  
- Nulls removed or filled with default values  
- Date formats standardised  
- Subject and payment types normalised for consistent analysis  
- Measures and calculated columns created using DAX for comparisons and KPIs
